## 📋 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### High Priority
- **Printer Integration Complexity** (Phase 3)
  - *Risk*: ZPL generation and P/Invoke may be complex
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simple test cases, thorough research
  - *Contingency*: Use existing .NET printing libraries as fallback

- **Performance with Large Datasets**
  - *Risk*: Slow UI with thousands of barcode records
  - *Mitigation*: Implement virtual scrolling, database paging
  - *Contingency*: Add database archiving functionality

#### Medium Priority
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
  - *Risk*: Currently Windows-only due to printer P/Invoke
  - *Mitigation*: Abstract printer interface for future platforms
  - *Contingency*: Keep Windows focus, add Linux/Mac later

### Resource Risks
- **Developer Availability**
  - *Risk*: Limited developer time for complex features
  - *Mitigation*: Break tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
  - *Contingency*: Prioritize core functionality over nice-to-haves
